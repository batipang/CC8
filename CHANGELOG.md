# Changelog

## foundation-20261102.1 — source snapshot

Independent components: assistant APK 0.8.7 / code 32, host 0.12.5,
diagnostics APK 1.0.1 / code 2, wire protocol 2. See `release.json` and
`docs/RELEASES.md`; this snapshot does not assert device acceptance.

- Establish required Linux/macOS CI, pinned quality tools, redacted history
  scanning and complete fixed Python package inventories.
- Harden binary/JSON boundaries and fix TLS descriptor release while a reader
  is active; add seeded protocol and real TLS concurrency tests.
- Validate non-secret settings across startup, service and builds, keeping
  credentials, pairing and original signing material separate.
- Add isolated setup/doctor/run commands and an owner OS lease across checkouts.
- Check API-27 APK signatures and installed certificates before device writes.
- Centralize independent versions and compatibility; bind artifact receipts to
  source revision, manifest and hashes, with annotated-tag verification.

The running installation remains assistant 0.8.6 / host 0.12.2 until separately
deployed. Human voice, physical handover, standby wake and long-run acceptance
remain open in `docs/TODO.md`.
